You are add spring security then that buy default add login form.
that login form username is "user" and password is generated in console ex.
Using generated security password: 4993bb38-8efe-49a0-a8dd-2da9d64a9eb7
this password is change wen reload project
after login done for logout write logout in url and enter ex.  localhost:8080/logout


spring security manage session id for another tab or another browser
in another tab not need to log-in again. but in another browser or like postman need to log-in again


for remove this default log in form do this
application.properties file =>
    spring.security.user.name = vishal
    spring.security.user.password = vishal08

restart project and log-in this username and password.
also you see in console this time password not generated.
and this password is not change, this is fix password

now with postman set Authentication -> basic auth and enter username and password

35:30 to 46:35 CSRF token
postman add_data and get_data request, Strident.java and StudentController.java file (post and get methods) =>
    for add data (like send data on database) than without spring security it's work
    you try it but comment spring security dependency (and maven reload) and restart project
    try to add data with proper body it's work check buy send get_data request. for security this is very bed.
    now uncomment spring security (and maven reload) and restart project
    then you try to add data it's not working showing 401 Unauthorized error

    Now with spring security form add data (send add_data request) ned csrf token.
    StudentController.java file getCsrfToken method to get csrf token.
    in postman send get_CSRF_token request and get token,
    then add token on add_data request header part. key is headerName and token is token from collected data by getCsrfToken method
