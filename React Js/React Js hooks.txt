Basic Hooks
These hooks manage state, side effects, and references in functional components.

useState

Manages local state in functional components.
Returns a state variable and a function to update it.
useEffect

Manages side effects, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM updates.
Runs after the render cycle.
useContext

Provides access to context values created with the React.createContext API.
Eliminates the need for prop drilling.
Additional Hooks
These are for performance optimization, complex state management, and DOM interactions.

useRef

Provides a mutable reference to a DOM element or a value that persists across renders.
useReducer

Alternative to useState for complex state logic.
Uses a reducer function to define state transitions.
useMemo

Memoizes a value to optimize performance.
Only recalculates when dependencies change.
useCallback

Memoizes a callback function to prevent unnecessary re-creations.
Useful in optimizing child component rendering.
useLayoutEffect

Similar to useEffect, but runs synchronously after DOM mutations and before the browser paints.
Used for layout adjustments.
useImperativeHandle

Customizes the instance value (ref) exposed when using React.forwardRef.
useDebugValue

Used in custom hooks to display debug information in React DevTools.
Custom Hook Development
React encourages creating custom hooks to encapsulate reusable logic.

useCustomHook (Custom)
A pattern for building reusable functionality with other hooks like useState and useEffect.
Example: useFetch, useAuth.
Server-Side and Experimental Hooks
These hooks are part of React's experimental or server-side rendering features.

useTransition

Manages transitions for UI updates, marking some updates as low-priority.
Useful for improving user experience during heavy updates.
useDeferredValue

Delays updating a value to prioritize other high-priority updates.
Often used with useTransition.
useSyncExternalStore

Used for subscribing to external stores (e.g., Redux) while ensuring a consistent state between server and client renders.
useId

Generates a unique ID for components, useful for accessibility attributes like id and htmlFor.
Upcoming or Advanced Hooks
These are experimental or used in specialized contexts.

useInsertionEffect
Runs before DOM mutations to insert styles or other effects directly into the DOM.
