1. List Interface
   - Common implementations:
     - ArrayList: Dynamic array; fast random access.
     - LinkedList: Doubly-linked list; efficient insertions/deletions.
     - Vector: Synchronized version of ArrayList (legacy).

2. Set Interface
   - Common implementations:
     - HashSet: Fast access; no order maintained.
     - LinkedHashSet: Maintains insertion order.
     - TreeSet: Sorted collection.

3. Map Interface
   - Common implementations:
     - HashMap: Fast key-based access; no order.
     - LinkedHashMap: Maintains insertion order.
     - TreeMap: Sorted keys.
     - ConcurrentHashMap: Thread-safe alternative.

4. Queue Interface
   - Common implementations:
     - PriorityQueue: Elements ordered by comparator.
     - ArrayDeque: Fast, resizable double-ended queue.

5. Deque Interface
   - Common implementations:
     - ArrayDeque (most popular).
     - LinkedList (legacy alternative).

6. Stack (Legacy Class)
   - Consider using ArrayDeque for stack functionality.

7. LinkedList
   - Implements both List and Deque interfaces.

8. SortedSet and SortedMap
   - Specializations for sorted collections:
     - TreeSet: Implements SortedSet.
     - TreeMap: Implements SortedMap.

Quick Tips:
- For random access: Use ArrayList.
- For frequent insert/delete: Use LinkedList or HashSet.
- For thread-safety: Use ConcurrentHashMap or Collections.synchronizedXXX.
- For sorted data: Use TreeSet or TreeMap.

1. Basics of Java for DSA
   - Data types, loops, arrays, strings.
   - Object-oriented concepts (OOP).

2. Mathematics for DSA
   - Prime numbers, GCD, LCM.
   - Modular arithmetic, bit manipulation.

3. Arrays
   - Basic operations: traversal, insertion, deletion.
   - Sliding window, two-pointer techniques.

4. Strings
   - Substrings, pattern matching (KMP, Rabin-Karp).
   - Palindromes, anagrams.

5. Linked Lists
   - Singly, doubly, circular linked lists.
   - Detect and remove cycles.

6. Stacks and Queues
   - Stack: balanced parentheses, postfix evaluation.
   - Queue: Simple, circular, priority queues.

7. Trees
   - Binary trees, traversals, binary search trees.
   - Heaps, Trie.

8. Graphs
   - Representations: adjacency matrix/list.
   - Traversals: BFS, DFS.
   - Shortest paths, MSTs, SCCs.

9. Hashing
   - Hash tables, hash maps, collision resolution.

10. Recursion and Backtracking
    - Subset generation, N-Queens, Sudoku.

11. Divide and Conquer
    - Merge sort, quick sort, binary search.

12. Dynamic Programming
    - Common problems: Fibonacci, LCS, knapsack.

13. Greedy Algorithms
    - Activity selection, Huffman coding.

14. Bit Manipulation
    - Count set bits, subset generation.

15. Sorting and Searching
    - Merge, quick, counting, radix sorts.
    - Binary search variations.

16. Advanced Data Structures
    - Segment trees, Fenwick trees, Union-Find.

17. Advanced Algorithms
    - KMP, FFT, matrix exponentiation.
